				As already said before (many many times), this event is here to celebrate what has happened, what's happening and what will happen (mostly what happened the past year but let's not think abt it too much).
				<br>
				The timeline above illustrates what's happened so far, with the important things starting after the first notch on the timeline.
				<br>
				The Wild West aWards themselves came into existence by putting more emphasis on one of our annual get-togethers (like the HalloWWeen event we have) and forming a small team, where each of the members focus on different projects. These projects come together under some discussion and careful planning to bring you the event show that you all (SURELY) know and love.
