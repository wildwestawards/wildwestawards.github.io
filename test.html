	Back during an age where things were arguably simpler (and also so much worse at the same time (don't look up old messages EVER)), yes I'm talking about 2017-2018 (we met during that time I think), ONE FRIEND GROUP DECIDED IT WOULD NOT BREAK UP (guess who), EVER. This friend group survived for a good few years, settings aside the collapse of The Playfield, and they all lived in harmony (or anarchy, whatever you wanna think) until present time. But woe is them, no one is there to celebrate their everlasting friendship (:broken_heart:).
	<br>
	...unless?... UNLESS 3 DUDES DECIDED THAT THIS HAS TO STOP. That's RIGHT, it's that time of the year again, this time with EVEN HIGHER ambitions, plans AND projects (and a higher budget ngl). Join us this year for the most fabulous and gilded awards on the planet, the Wild West aWards (you can praise us for the awesome acronym later). Whatever you remember from last year? Probably still there, BUT NOT JUST THAT (that would be really cheap and not so amazing compared to what's actually planned). Expect even more awards and crazy new reveals, celebrating the best of Wild West and our friend group as a whole. If you don't join, bad things will happen. Don't anger <s>daddy</s> THE COUNCIL (don't read what's behind that line, idk how that got there and I can't really remove it either).

	ANYWAY just show up ok

	This is the real meat of the website bitches
	<br>
	You've got two resources at your disposal: one video and one form (both carefully crafted and pushed through years of QA and QC (quality assurance and quality control) processes) so watch them!!!
	<br>
	idk if there's any order to it so I guess you should DEFINITELY imo (in my opinion) watch the video first, then head to the form. No, like for real
	<br> I did it the other way around and passed out for no reason and all I can do now is write shit on this website, like I have no physical body anymore
	<br> like bro someone laced this video+form hahaahahahaha... :(
	<br> ok yeah just listen to me, video then form, ok???? ok.
	here u go (idk if you'll get ads from playing it in the embed but you do you, not gonna figure that out for you looooooool):
